How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helps you to see where changes were made, so you can compare code and see what went wrong.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
If you mess something up you can go start over, take a couple steps back, etc.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You could forget, but you can choose when you want your commits done so it will make more sense.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
To keep files that interact with each other together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Can use it to check for changes/where mistakes began.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Won't have to be so concerned because you can just go back and check. Feel more confident with experimenting.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Saving commits while writing code to help track changes, fix bugs, etc.
