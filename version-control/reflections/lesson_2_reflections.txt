What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a new tracking/commit following system to track the changes/progess of your projects.
You need it to track the changes to your projects through commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is for the specific files that you want to make a commit on, where the working directory and the
repository contain all of the files. This is valuable because you only have to include the files where significant
changes were made.
